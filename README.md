# Estimates And Complexity

## Description/Abstract

This tale will last forty two and a half minutes.

How confident are you that this talk will last this long? What happens if we go over, or under? Are the reasons for it varying from that time fixed by external factors or complexities?

Most estimation goes badly wrong because it focusses on estimating the wrong things at the wrong times, without considering precision, complexity, and the reasons for the estimate in the first place. 

We're going to tell you all about what makes work predictable, and what makes it more difficult to understand. We'll help you ask the right questions in each situation so that you're as prepared as you can be.

If you want to go beyond simple time-based estimation, like story points, we've got a tale to tell you that'll change how you work forever... and it's only forty two and a half minutes long.

## Actionable Takeaways

After this session:

* You will have a number of tools that will help you estimate time, complexity, value, and other valuable concepts to shape your decision making.
* You will be able to understand when to avoid estimation entirely
* You'll understand when to use useful estimation techniques at the right times.


## Session outline (reviewers only)


I'm going to start by covering a number of the anti-patterns and misunderstandings we frequently see when people adopt agile in a rote way: they'll use things like story points without really understanding the questions they're trying to answer. I'll do this initially by interrogating the "forty two and a half minute" talk claim in the title, and helping people understand why it's minimally helpful, overly precise, and probably wrong. I'll then relate this to what we see in many software teams, and show that it's not all that different.

Then we'll cover some of the areas that people could find it more useful to probe with estimates: is this thing valuable? What are the chances of our approach succeeding? How well do we understand this, in the complexity sense? etc.

I'll then give attendees a number of estimation tools and techniques, with worked examples to help them do the right thing at the right time. This will cover complexity estimation (Liz Keogh's Capability Red), value estimation (probably some form of cost of delay), and planning estimation.

I'll bring it back together at the end to how I should've estimated the talk itself using complexity and value estimation, rather than time. Oh, and I probably won't finish exactly at forty two and a half minutes.
