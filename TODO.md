# Possible TODOs.

* Start: Walk on start a stopwatch and announce the title. Ask the audience how accurate they think the title will be. Get into the precision element too
* stopwatch conceit. After asking audience about accuracy and precision of my guess, get into the real question: does it matter? Time taken is something of a concern (I have to finish on time) but value from the talk is more important

* do we want to tie the complexity of the system of work to ability to estimate? I.e. teams that are highly interdependent get to be hard to predict.
* Noestimates? -- Probably, but only obliquely. Still too emotionally charged.

* The cargo cult of story points - Blindly adhered to, rarely understood, rarely to answer a specific question, without consideration of complexity etc


* "When a software delivery group is forced to estimate tasks, this tends to trap them in an environment of obligation without responsibility. And often the person demanding these estimates finds themself in the very same trap.

Who will free them? or will they be forced to take the (often) significant risk of breaking free?

* ""If the train leaves every 5 minutes you don't care about a timetable. If it leaves every 2 days you want to know *exactly* when it leaves"
Great analogy from @hamrin reflecting on planning, estimating and software delivery." https://twitter.com/mfloryan/status/1605560746040995841

* "I disagree with the idea that story points are valuable, not for the estimate, but for the conversation. That conversation is focused on the wrong thing: implementation rather than value. Instead, collaboratively make the story smaller." https://mstdn.social/@allenholub/109700211594465552

* "In complexity spaces you can't just look at the facts because you don't know which facts will be relevant." -- Brian Marick - from his podcast, Oddly Influenced

* Estimates: what conversations are you having as a result of estimating? None? Then your estimates are likely waste. If you’re going to do it regardless, then skip the estimate. What might be more valuable is slicing. Slicing is in the ball park of estimation: guessing at smaller parts that have value and order (I.e. “I believe we need this part first and it’ll deliver x”)

* wrote a talk on BDD. Normally 1 hr for each minute spoken, when you include research/slides etc. Decided to do this much faster given context (internal/informal). Guessed I'd do it in 2 minutes for each minute spoken - Roughyl an hour. Got a draft done but it was terrible. Timeboxed 2 more hours working. Better, acceptable quality. Wanted a little more. 2 more hours and it was where I wanted. 5 hours to estimate something I know how to do and have done before; even though I know it normally takes way longer. Let me iterate! This is a good thing. I could decide when to stop and how much to invest!

* The role of precision - when to be more or less precise

* The startship troopers scene changed "the only good estimate is a dead estimate"

* WSJF. Different versions. While later versions misunderstand the purpose of the original, they can still be useful. Use what you need. Understand what they're not giving you.

"A few people asked me recently for my opinion on estimates in SW. Honestly, they're OK, especially coarse-grained to choose priorities or assign resources and people.

A *focus* on estimates, though... that way lies pain, suffering and too much context-switching. And I hates it."

"If I estimate something at 5 days, how much faster than that might it be?

We might find it's trivial or already done, so we might save 5 days.

How much SLOWER can it be?"

Follow-up: https://mas.to/@lunivore/109987484364423857

"Work can be infinitely slower than estimate (if it is, we usually give up and do something different).

The more innovative it is, the more discoveries there are. They will tend to slow you down more than speed you up.

That's why nobody in software is good at estimates."

* Sketch
  * Who thinks I'll be done in time?
  * Does it matter?
  * When *would* it matter?
    * What other practices would help?
  * What info do you have aout my talks? Seen me speak?
  * What if I said I've never gone longer than I said I would?
  * Okay, but what if I said I've never done *this* talk before?
  * How does this relate to your work?
