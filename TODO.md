# Possible TODOs.

* do we want to tie the complexity of the system of work to ability to estimate? I.e. teams that are highly interdependent get to be hard to predict.
* Noestimates? -- Probably, but only obliquely. Still too emotionally charged.

* ""If the train leaves every 5 minutes you don't care about a timetable. If it leaves every 2 days you want to know *exactly* when it leaves"
Great analogy from @hamrin reflecting on planning, estimating and software delivery." https://twitter.com/mfloryan/status/1605560746040995841

* "I disagree with the idea that story points are valuable, not for the estimate, but for the conversation. That conversation is focused on the wrong thing: implementation rather than value. Instead, collaboratively make the story smaller." https://mstdn.social/@allenholub/109700211594465552

* "In complexity spaces you can't just look at the facts because you don't know which facts will be relevant." -- Brian Marick - from his podcast, Oddly Influenced

* Estimates: what conversations are you having as a result of estimating? None? Then your estimates are likely waste. If you’re going to do it regardless, then skip the estimate. What might be more valuable is slicing. Slicing is in the ball park of estimation: guessing at smaller parts that have value and order (I.e. “I believe we need this part first and it’ll deliver x”)

* wrote a talk on BDD. Normally 1 hr for each minute spoken, when you include research/slides etc. Decided to do this much faster given context (internal/informal). Guessed I'd do it in 2 minutes for each minute spoken - Roughyl an hour. Got a draft done but it was terrible. Timeboxed 2 more hours working. Better, acceptable quality. Wanted a little more. 2 more hours and it was where I wanted. 5 hours to estimate something I know how to do and have done before; even though I know it normally takes way longer. Let me iterate! This is a good thing. I could decide when to stop and how much to invest!

* The role of precision - when to be more or less precise

* The startship troopers scene changed "the only good estimate is a dead estimate"

* WSJF. Different versions. While later versions misunderstand the purpose of the original, they can still be useful. Use what you need. Understand what they're not giving you.

"A few people asked me recently for my opinion on estimates in SW. Honestly, they're OK, especially coarse-grained to choose priorities or assign resources and people.

A *focus* on estimates, though... that way lies pain, suffering and too much context-switching. And I hates it."

* Keogh: https://mas.to/@lunivore/109987482973920249

"If I estimate something at 5 days, how much faster than that might it be?

We might find it's trivial or already done, so we might save 5 days.

How much SLOWER can it be?"

Follow-up: https://mas.to/@lunivore/109987484364423857

"Work can be infinitely slower than estimate (if it is, we usually give up and do something different).

The more innovative it is, the more discoveries there are. They will tend to slow you down more than speed you up.

That's why nobody in software is good at estimates."

* increasingly large story points values means saying “I know less and less about this”. Thinking you can be predictable and large is folly. Slice your stories. -- Analogy: one marble is easy. five marbles is fine. Jar full of marbles - literally a game of chance.

* Sketch
  * Who thinks I'll be done in time?

  * What info do you have aout my talks? Seen me speak?
  * What if I said I've never gone longer than I said I would?
  * Okay, but what if I said I've never done *this* talk before?
  *   * Does it matter?
  * When *would* it matter?
    * What other practices would help?
  * How does this relate to your work?

* Reduce wait time to improve lead timeshttps://mastodon.social/@malcolm/110454288640880567  - https://malcolmbastien.com/2023/05/29/why-work-waits/


* Deadline 

* AS a team with stakeholders (including maanger), use bdd, slicing, etc to understand alignment. Overcommunicate on where we are. Get to flow.

* Get to CI/CD. Technical practices prevent anxiet anout the once per month issue.

* like this talk, where there’s been lots of talk about the talk, most talk about estimates are about estimates and not about the work/value

* Building options/slicing: I'm not following a script. I'm not an actor who has to say all the lines, and in the right order. I'm a practioner who understands a domain, and have a decent idea of how to move the talk around. I can do this on the fly. If I want to, I can jump forward and skip whole sections that you don't know exist. I have sliced the talk into chapters.
TODO relate this to work slicing. value.


^ TODO predict the future: count cat/dog pics in last few talks. Ask how many this will have?
^ don't like story points
Reasons why
* The cargo cult of story points - Blindly adhered to, rarely understood, rarely to answer a specific question, without consideration of complexity etc
precision
 - SPs are at a poor level of precision. Neither particularly precise for when that's appropriate, or revealing of the inherent error bound and unknowns in the estimate. 
people think they can do things like capacity with them.
- the Tuckman model myth in modern dynamic systems.
- Dynamic reteaming - When was last time someone joined/left your team? parental leave? Sick leave? Secondment?
- NOT advocating for 
people doing maths

^ TODO slicing how why mechanisms
  - Slice small using metrics that prioritise value
    - Smallest version that adds critical value
  - Slice for value, then flow.
  - Deliver often.
  - CI/CD == Vital capability for delivery


* Is it worth adding in a hierarchy of estimates? Complexity/understanding are necessary (and higher) than time based estimation.
* Key problem is people reach for time first, and use for everything.
* One of the pillars of the talk was highly dependant teams. Wasn't needed. Interesting but inessential. Sliced it out.
* Visualise breakdown of talk i.e. sl;icing of it
* Inherent uncertainty in estimates based on experience. Has to be represented. Tie to story points.
* "When will it be done?" done isn't a useful framing. Systems aren't done until we get rid of them. They evolve. When will a feature be ready? But the whole feature or an MVP? Reframe: when will we get value? SOON.
* Lean into slicing as a mechanism for building trust to avoid estimation while proving value

* Re-emphasis actual delivery i.e. what we did in Managed Eng re the review.
* More on data gathering

* Is jump into complexity jarring? Needs smoothed?
* Benefits of slicing in terms of predictability.
* Revise the monte carlo stuff. Make sure it's understandable.
* Talk about how my team don't estimate. Maybe how we slice and how we deal with complexity.
* More on what to do, rather than what not do.
* Too long on precision of estimates.
* Too meta slide: put bullet points on that show all the things that are wrong with the process (upfront, estimated in time etc). Go back to start and have those same bullet points as a frame



* Validity of data after people leave.
* "We use estimates for shared understanding. Different story points mean we have different understandings". Honestly, I'm fine with that. But then throw the SPs away. Don't bring them over and pretend they're now a useful time metric.
* Make a better monte carlo slide. More data, ranges, percentages etc
* remove the bit about slicing the presentation itself.
* The great thing about time is we get to waste it at a cheap rate: one day per day. Money? You can spend an unbound amount of that. Time is cheap. Wait, one day per person per day. How cheap are people?
* Tools for monte carlo
* What we want is "Can we afford this? Can get this done?", but what we ask is "When will we get this?" Anyone hearing t
