# Possible TODOs.

* Start: Walk on start a stopwatch and announce the title. Ask the audience how accurate they think the title will be. Get into the precision element too
* stopwatch conceit. After asking audience about accuracy and precision of my guess, get into the real question: does it matter? Time taken is something of a concern (I have to finish on time) but value from the talk is more important

* do we want to tie the complexity of the system of work to ability to estimate? I.e. teams that are highly interdependent get to be hard to predict.
* Noestimates? -- Probably, but only obliquely. Still too emotionally charged.


* "When a software delivery group is forced to estimate tasks, this tends to trap them in an environment of obligation without responsibility. And often the person demanding these estimates finds themself in the very same trap.

Who will free them? or will they be forced to take the (often) significant risk of breaking free?

* ""If the train leaves every 5 minutes you don't care about a timetable. If it leaves every 2 days you want to know *exactly* when it leaves"
Great analogy from @hamrin reflecting on planning, estimating and software delivery." https://twitter.com/mfloryan/status/1605560746040995841

* "I disagree with the idea that story points are valuable, not for the estimate, but for the conversation. That conversation is focused on the wrong thing: implementation rather than value. Instead, collaboratively make the story smaller." https://mstdn.social/@allenholub/109700211594465552
